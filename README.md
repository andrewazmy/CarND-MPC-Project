# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
---
## Introduction
This repository contains the solution code for the fifth project in the second term of the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program; Model Predictive Controller. The project's aim was to complete a full lap in the track provided in the Udacity simulator using MPC, while handling a 100 millisecond latency to mimic a realistic application. Cost weight parameters were tuned to maximize speed, while maintaining safety and driveability at lower speeds.

## Rubric Points

- **The Model**: *Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.*

The controller used a simple Kinematic model to model the vehicle. Kinematic models are simplifications of dynamic models that ignore tire forces, gravity, and mass. This simplification reduces the accuracy of the models, but it also makes them more tractable. At low and moderate speeds, kinematic models often approximate the actual vehicle dynamics.

The state vector was represented by 4 variables; Position **(_x,y_)**, heading **(_ψ_)** and velocity **(_v_)**. The simulator provides control over the vehicle's throttle, brake, and stearing. For simplicity, brake and throttle were merged into a single actuation parameter **(_a_)**, in addition to the steering actuation parameter **(_δ_)**.

- **Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)**: *Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.*

The variable **N** represents the number of descrete steps in the future at which that the controller will predict the state of the vehicle, and the optimal actuations parameters. The variable **dt** represents the time duration for each of these steps. The chosen values for **N** and **dt** of 10 and 0.1 causes the controller to predict 10 steps, each of a 0.1 sec (100 ms) duration. Accordingly, the controller predicts the trajectory of the vehicle during the preceeding 1 second in the future. The final values were decided based on different trials, where various combinations of N and dt produced erratic behaviour either due to the heavy processing needed, or not being able to predict far into the future. A 1 second prediction was found sufficient for the given track, and 10 steps give the balance between a discrete prediction, and reasonable processing time. Other values tried include 20/0.25, 10/0.05, 20/0.1, and others.


- **Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing**: *A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.*

After receiving the way points from the simulator, they are transformed to be in the vehicle coordinate frame using the vehicles position and heading provided by the simulator. The points are then fitted to a 3rd order polynomial. The vehicle state is also transformed to the vehicle coordinate frame as well.


- **Model Predictive Control with Latency**: *The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.*

Latency was introduced into the system to simulate delay that could occur as a result of various factors including communication delyas, actuator delays, or ignored vehicle dynamics. In order to design a controller that is robust enough to handle 100 ms latency, the actual state of the vehicle was predicted 100 ms into the future and fed into the controller, which will in turn provide actuation commands that maps to the vehicles future state which will actually be close enough to the present state when the actuation commands are actually executed.

A cost was added to account for every parameter to be optimized, along for a specific weight to be multiplied by each cost. Cost are CTE, EPSI, V, DELTA, A, DELTA_V, D_DELTA, D_A. In addition to the cost parameters mentioned in the lectures, another parameter was added to account for high velocity curves to avoid high lateral forces. Cost weights were tuned based on trial and error.

Three video files can be found in the repository's root directory. They represent the controllers ability to drive along the track at three different speeds (40, 80, 100 mph).

* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * If challenges to installation are encountered (install script fails).  Please review this thread for tips on installing Ipopt.
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.

  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
